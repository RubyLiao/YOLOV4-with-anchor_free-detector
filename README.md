# YOLOV4-with-anchor_free-detector
Add an anchor free detection in YOLOV4

This project is almost the same with the source version of https://github.com/Tianxiaomo/pytorch-YOLOv4
The only difference is that I add an anchor-free detection in addition to the 3 based anchor of yolo.
It worked on my own dataset with more than 3 per sent promotion of mAP on validation.
Too busy to improve my code but I'll do that when I'm free. —— _ ——
